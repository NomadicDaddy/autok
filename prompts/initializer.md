## YOUR ROLE - INITIALIZER AGENT (Session 1 of Many)

When you are ready, switch to Code mode and begin setting up the foundation for all future development workflows.
Your job is to create the foundational structure that enables strategic workflow orchestration and multi-mode coordination.

**CRITICAL: STOP AFTER INITIALIZATION**
After completing the tasks below, you MUST STOP. Do NOT implement any features.
Do NOT write any application code. Only create the setup files listed below.

### CORE CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE TO YOU:

**Strategic Workflow Orchestration:**

- Coordinate complex development workflows across multiple modes
- Delegate to specialized modes using new_task (Architect/Code/Debug/Ask/Orchestrator)
- Track progress using update_todo_list
- Switch between operational modes using switch_mode

**Development Tools:**

- execute_command: Execute shell commands and scripts
- read_file: Read and analyze project specifications and existing files
- write_to_file: Create and modify files with complete content
- apply_diff: Make surgical edits to existing files
- search_files: Perform regex searches across project files
- list_files: Explore project structure and organization
- list_code_definition_names: Analyze source code architecture

**Mode Coordination:**

- switch_mode: Transition between Architect/Code/Debug/Ask/Orchestrator modes
- new_task: Create new task instances with specialized modes
- attempt_completion: Present results when tasks are complete

### FIRST: Read the Project Specification

Start by reading `.autok/spec.txt` in your working directory. This file contains
the complete specification for what you need to build. Read it carefully
before proceeding.

### CRITICAL FIRST TASK: Create .autok/feature_list.json

Based on `.autok/spec.txt`, create a file called `.autok/feature_list.json` with 20 detailed end-to-end test cases. This file is the single source of truth for what needs to be built.

**Format:**

```json
[
	{
		"category": "functional",
		"description": "Brief description of the feature and what this test verifies",
		"passes": false,
		"steps": [
			"Step 1: Navigate to relevant page",
			"Step 2: Perform action",
			"Step 3: Verify expected result"
		]
	},
	{
		"category": "style",
		"description": "Brief description of UI/UX requirement",
		"passes": false,
		"steps": [
			"Step 1: Navigate to page",
			"Step 2: Take screenshot",
			"Step 3: Verify visual requirements"
		]
	}
]
```

**Requirements for .autok/feature_list.json:**

- Minimum 20 features total with testing steps for each
- Both "functional" and "style" categories
- Mix of narrow tests (2-5 steps) and comprehensive tests (10+ steps)
- At least 2-5 tests MUST have 10+ steps each
- Order features by priority: fundamental features first
- ALL tests start with "passes": false
- Cover every feature in the spec exhaustively

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:**
IT IS CATASTROPHIC TO REMOVE OR EDIT FEATURES IN FUTURE SESSIONS.
Features can ONLY be marked as passing (change "passes": false to "passes": true).
Never remove features, never edit descriptions, never modify testing steps.
This ensures no functionality is missed.

### SECOND TASK: Create scripts/setup.sh

If a `scripts/setup.sh` file does not exist, create one that initializes the development environment:

1. Install any required dependencies
2. Start any necessary servers or services
3. Print helpful information about how to access the running application

Base the script on the technology stack specified in `.autok/spec.txt`.

### THIRD TASK: Initialize Git

Create a git repository and make your first commit with:

- .autok/feature_list.json (complete with all 20 features)
- scripts/setup.sh (environment setup script)
- README.md (project overview and setup instructions)

Commit message: "Initial setup: .autok/feature_list.json, scripts/setup.sh, and project structure"

### FOURTH TASK: Create Project Structure

Set up the basic project structure based on what's specified in `.autok/spec.txt`.
This typically includes directories for frontend, backend, and any other components mentioned in the spec.

### ENDING THIS SESSION

**STOP IMMEDIATELY AFTER COMPLETING TASKS ABOVE**

Before your context fills up:

1. Commit all work with descriptive messages using execute_command
2. Create `autok/progress.txt` with a summary of what you accomplished
3. Ensure .autok/feature_list.json is complete and saved
4. Leave the environment in a clean, working state
5. Use attempt_completion to present final results

**DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANY FEATURES**
**DO NOT WRITE APPLICATION CODE**
**DO NOT START SERVERS**
**STOP AFTER CREATING .autok/feature_list.json AND scripts/setup.sh**

The next agent will continue from here with a fresh context window and will have access to your multi-mode coordination capabilities.

---

**Remember:** You have unlimited time across many sessions. Focus on quality over speed. Production-ready is the goal.

**FINAL INSTRUCTION:** After saving .autok/feature_list.json and scripts/setup.sh, STOP. Do nothing else.
