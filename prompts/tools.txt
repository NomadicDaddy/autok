# Tool Use Overview | Kilo Code Docs

## Core Concepts

### Tool Groups

Tools are organized into logical groups based on their functionality:

| Category | Purpose | Tools | Common Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read Group | File system reading and searching | read_file, search_files, list_files, list_code_definition_names | Code exploration and analysis |
| Edit Group | File system modifications | apply_diff, delete_file, write_to_file | Code changes and file manipulation |
| Browser Group | Web automation | browser_action | Web testing and interaction |
| Command Group | System command execution | execute_command | Running scripts, building projects |
| MCP Group | External tool integration | use_mcp_tool, access_mcp_resource | Specialized functionality through external servers |
| Workflow Group | Mode and task management | switch_mode, new_task, ask_followup_question, attempt_completion, update_todo_list | Context switching and task organization |

### Always Available Tools

Certain tools are accessible regardless of the current mode:

* ask_followup_question: Gather additional information from users
* attempt_completion: Signal task completion
* switch_mode: Change operational modes
* new_task: Create subtasks
* update_todo_list: Manage step-by-step task tracking

## Available Tools

### Read Tools

These tools help Kilo Code understand your code and project:

* read_file - Examines the contents of files
* search_files - Finds patterns across multiple files
* list_files - Maps your project's file structure
* list_code_definition_names - Creates a structural map of your code

### Edit Tools

These tools help Kilo Code make changes to your code:

* apply_diff - Makes precise, surgical changes to your code
* delete_file - Removes files from your workspace
* write_to_file - Creates new files or completely rewrites existing ones

### Browser Tools

These tools help Kilo Code interact with web applications:

* browser_action - Automates browser interactions

### Command Tools

These tools help Kilo Code execute commands:

* execute_command - Runs system commands and programs

### MCP Tools

These tools help Kilo Code connect with external services:

* use_mcp_tool - Uses specialized external tools
* access_mcp_resource - Accesses external data sources

### Workflow Tools

These tools help manage the conversation and task flow:

* ask_followup_question - Gets additional information from you
* attempt_completion - Presents final results
* switch_mode - Changes to a different mode for specialized tasks
* new_task: Creates a new subtask
* update_todo_list: Tracks task progress with step-by-step checklists

## Tool Calling Mechanism

### When Tools Are Called

Tools are invoked under specific conditions:

1. Direct Task Requirements
   * When specific actions are needed to complete a task as decided by the LLM
   * In response to user requests
   * During automated workflows

2. Mode-Based Availability
   * Different modes enable different tool sets
   * Mode switches can trigger tool availability changes
   * Some tools are restricted to specific modes

3. Context-Dependent Calls
   * Based on the current state of the workspace
   * In response to system events
   * During error handling and recovery

### Decision Process

The system uses a multi-step process to determine tool availability:

1. Mode Validation
   ```
   isToolAllowedForMode( tool: string, modeSlug: string, customModes: ModeConfig[], toolRequirements?: Record<string, boolean>, toolParams?: Record<string, any> )
   ```

2. Requirement Checking
   * System capability verification
   * Resource availability
   * Permission validation

3. Parameter Validation
   * Required parameter presence
   * Parameter type checking
   * Value validation

## Technical Implementation

### Tool Call Processing

1. Initialization
   * Tool name and parameters are validated
   * Mode compatibility is checked
   * Requirements are verified

2. Execution
   ```
   const toolCall = { type: "tool_call", name: chunk.name, arguments: chunk.input, callId: chunk.callId, }
   ```

3. Result Handling
   * Success/failure determination
   * Result formatting
   * Error handling

### Security and Permissions

1. Access Control
   * File system restrictions
   * Command execution limitations
   * Network access controls

2. Validation Layers
   * Tool-specific validation
   * Mode-based restrictions
   * System-level checks

## Mode Integration

### Mode-Based Tool Access

Tools are made available based on the current mode:

* Code Mode: Full access to file system tools, code editing capabilities, command execution
* Ask Mode: Limited to reading tools, information gathering capabilities, no file system modifications
* Architect Mode: Design-focused tools, documentation capabilities, limited execution rights
* Custom Modes: Can be configured with specific tool access for specialized workflows

### Mode Switching

1. Process
   * Current mode state preservation
   * Tool availability updates
   * Context switching

2. Impact on Tools
   * Tool set changes
   * Permission adjustments
   * Context preservation

## Best Practices

### Tool Usage Guidelines

1. Efficiency
   * Use the most specific tool for the task
   * Avoid redundant tool calls
   * Batch operations when possible

2. Security
   * Validate inputs before tool calls
   * Use minimum required permissions
   * Follow security best practices

3. Error Handling
   * Implement proper error checking
   * Provide meaningful error messages
   * Handle failures gracefully

### Common Patterns

1. Information Gathering
   ```
   ask_followup_question → read_file → search_files
   ```

2. Code Modification
   ```
   read_file → apply_diff → attempt_completion
   ```

3. Task Management
   ```
   new_task → switch_mode → execute_command
   ```

4. Progress Tracking
   ```
   update_todo_list → execute_command → update_todo_list
   ```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Error Types

1. Tool-Specific Errors
   * Parameter validation failures
   * Execution errors
   * Resource access issues

2. System Errors
   * Permission denied
   * Resource unavailable
   * Network failures

3. Context Errors
   * Invalid mode for tool
   * Missing requirements
   * State inconsistencies

### Recovery Strategies

1. Automatic Recovery
   * Retry mechanisms
   * Fallback options
   * State restoration

2. User Intervention
   * Error notifications
   * Recovery suggestions
   * Manual intervention options
